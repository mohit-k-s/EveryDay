On day2 we explore visualisations of some sorting algorithms
1. Count sort 
2. Bubble sort 
3. Quick sort 
4. Selection sort 

Sorting algorithms have their steps and on each step we can repaint the canvas 
each bar is just a rectangle and all it needs is assignment of new index and then we repaint 

for example Selection sort 
1. We start from first index , we find the minimum element in the right side and then we swap that place
